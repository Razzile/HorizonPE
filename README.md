HorizonPE
=========

HorizonPE is an in-development mod menu for Minecraft: Pocket Edition. It is not intended to be the best and only mod menu out there but instead, to give people a good open source example of minecraft PE mods without having to be built around any external frameworks.

Status
======

Currently, HorizonPE is in early development. While a few of the mods are done, there is still a long way to go. Including creating the mod menu to appear in-game.
Update: Due to me having much too many projects at once, HorizonPE is currently in a paused state of development :c

I welcome forks and pull requests, as long as you follow my overly unnecassary coding style (bad habit, yes I know :P)
