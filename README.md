HorizonPE
=========

HorizonPE is an in-development mod menu for Minecraft: Pocket Edition. It is not intended to be the best and only mod menu out there but instead, to give people a good open source example of minecraft PE mods without having to be built around any external frameworks.

Status
======

Currently, HorizonPE is on hold as I haven't had time to work on it recently. This project should pick up again in the summer

I welcome forks and pull requests, as long as you follow my overly unnecassary coding style (bad habit, yes I know :P)
