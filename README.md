HorizonPE
=========

HorizonPE is an in-development mod menu for minecraft pocket edition. It is not intended to be the best and only mod menu out there but instead, to give people a good open source example of minecraft PE mods without having to be built around any external frameworks.

Status
======

Currently, HorizonPE is in early development. While a few of the mods are done, there is still a long way to go. Including creating the mod menu to appear in-game.

I welcome forks and pull requests, as long as you follow my overly unneccassary coding style (bad habit, yes I know :P)
